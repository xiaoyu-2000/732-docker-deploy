# Hi there! This is my Inventory Management Flask APP (Docker-Based)

This project is a fully containerized inventory management system that includes:

- ‚úÖ React Frontend (served by Nginx)
- ‚úÖ Flask Backend API (RESTful)
- ‚úÖ MongoDB Database

## Which means
> You don't need to install Node.js, Python, pip, or MongoDB!
>
> With Docker installed, you can run the entire system with a single command.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaoyu-2000/732-docker-deploy.git
cd 732-docker-deploy
```


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start all services (frontend, backend, and MongoDB)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the frontend (React)
- Build the backend (Flask)
- Start MongoDB
- Launch everything in connected containers


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional - First Time Only) Import MongoDB Data

> There is a `mongo-dump/` folder from the project root and you need to import sample data, run the following script:

```bash
./import_dump.sh
```

This will:
- Copy the dump folder into the MongoDB container
- Restore the `testdb` database inside the container

You only need to do this **once** on a fresh setup.
